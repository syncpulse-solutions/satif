## Adapter Objects

```python
class Adapter(ABC)
```

> Abstract Base Class for SDIF adapters.
>
> An Adapter defines a standardized interface for components that transform
> an input SDIF (Standardized Data Interchange Format) database into an output
> SDIF database. Transformations can include schema modifications, data
> reshaping, content enrichment, or other alterations.
>
> The core principle is to take one SDIF representation (specified by its file path)
> and produce another, typically aiming to preserve or appropriately modify
> the informational content while potentially changing its structure to suit
> different analytical or processing needs.
>
> Adapters are expected to operate asynchronously.

#### adapt

```python
@abstractmethod
def adapt(sdif: SDIFPath) -> Path
```

> Adapts an SDIF database file.
>
> Implementations of this method are responsible for:
> 1.  Accepting the file path to an input SDIF database.
> 2.  Performing a transformation on the data. This typically involves
> reading from the input, processing, and writing to a new SDIF file.
> 3.  Returning the file path to the newly created, adapted SDIF database.
>
> The input SDIF file should generally be treated as read-only by the
> adapter&#x27;s direct logic; modifications should be made to a copy or
> a new file to ensure the original input is preserved.
>
> **Arguments**:
>
> - `sdif` - The SDIF data source(s) to adapt. This can be:
>   - A single SDIF file path (str or Path).
>   - An `SDIFDatabase` instance.
>
>
> **Returns**:
>
>   A `pathlib.Path` object pointing to the newly created and
>   adapted SDIF database file.
>
>
> **Raises**:
>
> - `FileNotFoundError` - If the `sdif_input_path` does not exist, is not a file,
>   or is otherwise inaccessible.
> - `AdapterError` - (Or a subclass thereof) For errors specific to the
>   adaptation process itself. Concrete implementations may define
>   and raise more specific error types.
> - `Exception` - For other unexpected errors encountered during adaptation.
